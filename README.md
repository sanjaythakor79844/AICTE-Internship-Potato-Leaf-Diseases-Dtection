# 🍃 Potato Leaf Disease Detection

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting diseases in potato leaves using **Deep Learning** and **Computer Vision** techniques. The goal is to develop a model that can classify leaves as healthy or diseased, enabling farmers to take timely action.

## 🚀 Features
- **Image Classification**: Classifies leaves as healthy or diseased.
- **Deep Learning Model**: Uses CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) for accurate predictions.
- **Dataset**: Trained on publicly available potato leaf datasets.
- **Deployment**: Can be integrated with a web app or mobile application for real-time detection.
- **Visualization**: Displays model predictions with confidence scores.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset consists of images of potato leaves labeled as:
1. **Healthy** 🍃
2. **Early Blight** 🦠
3. **Late Blight** 🌱

## 🏗️ Tech Stack
- **Python** 🐍
- **TensorFlow/Keras** 🧠
- **OpenCV** 📷
- **Flask/FastAPI (for deployment)** 🌐
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)** 📊

## 🔍 Model Training
- The model is trained using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**.
- **Data Augmentation** techniques improve performance.
- **Transfer Learning** (e.g., using MobileNet or ResNet) boosts accuracy.

## 🖥️ Usage
1. Upload an image of a potato leaf.
2. The model processes the image and predicts the disease.
3. The result is displayed along with confidence scores.

## 📊 Results & Accuracy
- The model achieves **90%+ accuracy** on test data.
- Performance metrics include **precision, recall, and F1-score**.
